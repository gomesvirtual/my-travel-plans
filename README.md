# My Favorite Movie Trailers

This project was made entirely in python 2.7 merging some html, css and javascript to build a web page listing my favorite movie trailers and running them according to users interaction.

## How to Use (Windows users)

Right click on the **entertainment_center.py** file and then edit with idle
After that, click on _Run_ -> _Run module_ or just press f5 on keyboard 
Wait until the web page is fully loaded and then click on the movie poster to play its trailer. 
Once you've done that, the movie trailer will load over the current page and it'll start to run.
